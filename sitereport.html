				<h2>Module Experience</h2>
				<p>At the start of the module, I learned the basics of git and github. I created a new repository and learned the concept of git clone, add, commit, push and pull. I understood the concept of version control systems and how those systems work. I learned the importance of using VCS like github. It gives us the features of having a backup of the code, having the ability to restore older versions of our code and also work our code with multiple developers together.</p>
				<p>I learned about the basics of HTML and CSS. Different HTML tags were introduced and their definitions were taught. I learned about single and paired HTML tags. I also learned basic properties of CSS like fonts, text sizes, colors, background, margin, padding, etc. I also learned how to write CSS by inline, internal or external method. I also did the exercise provided on the module. It helped me to apply the knowledge practically. I also learned to use developer tools and inspect elements on the website.</p>
				<p>I really liked learning the layout and positioning properties in CSS. This gave me a higher control in styling websites. Learning about flexbox and grid was very interesting. These properties gave me the ability to design the layout of website easily. Also learning about responsive web design and using media queries to create a responsive website was also very interesting. I really liked creating a responsive website which worked across all screen sizes. Different modern website design practices were also taught in the module which gave me an idea of creating a modern looking website.</p>
				<p>I really liked the web development module. The module covered many aspects of HTML and CSS from basic to advanced. Furthermore, working with various projects provided by the module helped in further understanding of the topic. The lecutre and tutorial classes were really good.</p>

				<h2>Site Development</h2>
				<p>I started the development of my portfolio website on <time datetime="2022-07-20">July 20, 2022</time>. I have tried to regularly commit and push codes to the github servers since then.</p>
				<h3>Technical Aspect</h3>
				<p>I have tried my best to use proper HTML tags as much as possible. I have used classes and id on my HTML elements. External method is used to link css in the code. Media queries are used and proper meta tag is given to make the queries work properly. Copyright free images are being used in the website and proper referencing is given in the reference section of this page.</p>
				<p>The website is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes. Flexbox and grid both have been used in the code. Utilization of both of those properties has given a lot of flexibilty in designing the layout of website. Furthermore some animations have also been used. The navigation bar also has a menu which is functional and is made purely by using CSS.</p>
				<h3>Design Aspect</h3>
				<p>I chose a minimalist design, to make the website look clean and beautiful. Adding a light gradient background made the design come together and look better. I had chosen a white background for main contents in the website. The white background and linear gradient colors seperated really well and I chose this as the main theme of the website. I looked at many different portfolio website examples, and took inspiration from many websites. I combined what I thought looked great and designed the website.</p>

				<p>The navigation bar is functional and responsive. It turns into a hamburger menu when the screen width decreases to 768px.</p>
				<img src="../images/report/nav-2.jpg" alt="nav-2">
				<p>The navigation bar is made entirely from HTML and CSS. No javascript is being used in the code. This is done by a checkbox trick. All of the pages in the website can be navigated easily from the navigation bar. The color of the bar is black and texts are colored white.</p>
				<p>I have used a linear gradient background for the body of the website. I think using this makes the website look more modern. Contents on the website uses white background for better readability. I have used box shadow property to give components 3D effect and help them seperate from background. I have utilized both flexbox and grid with media queries to make the website responsive. Google fonts is being used in the website.</p>
